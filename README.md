# Ticket-System
This project is a terminal-based Data Structures application designed to manage a ticketing system for a baseball stadium. Its primary goal is to allow users to make seat reservations for a client through an interactive, input-driven terminal interface. We implemented multiple data structures to effectively store and manipulate user-provided data, as well as to search for available seats for reservation. Specifically, we used a Set to store the available seats in the stadium, a LinkedList to maintain the history of reservations or the transaction log, a HashMap to map customers to the seats they had reserved, a Stack to implement the undo functionality for the last reservation or cancellation action, and a Queue to manage a waiting list for customers when all seats in a particular section were reserved. The project also emphasized teamwork by assigning specific tasks to each team member and maintaining consistent communication to ensure all work was completed ahead of the deadlines set by the group.

Significant effort was made to address as many edge cases as possible, ensuring robust functionality. Although managing and visualizing the interactions between the various methods and data structures proved to be a challenging task, the team successfully navigated these difficulties to deliver a well-structured solution.
