# Ticket-System
This is a Data Structures project on terminal involving multiple data structure to handle a ticket system of a baseball field
#  To Do:
**I think** that our code doesn't meet the requirements on the stack usage, it's supposed to work as an deshacer tool but it isnâ€™t being use for anything really so, probably we should ask the professor.
Test the code to find bugs.
